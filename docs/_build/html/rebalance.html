<h1>Rebalance<a class="headerlink" href="#rebalance" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Runnel workers must coordinate ownership over a set of partitioned Redis stream keys.
This is conducted via a dynamic ‘rebalance’ algorithm described below.</p>
<div class="section" id="a-single-worker">
<h2>A single worker<a class="headerlink" href="#a-single-worker" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Let’s start with a simple case: a single worker joins an empty group to begin processing
events. Let’s assume the stream has 8 partitions.</p>
<img alt="_images/rebalance-1.png" src="_images/rebalance-1.png" />
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Worker 1 announces it has joined the group. It does this by editing the membership
key in Redis (see <a class="reference internal" href="architecture.html#redis-keys"><span class="std std-ref">Redis Keys</span></a>). Since there are no other workers, it will
assign itself every partition of the stream. It also adds a message to the control
stream to notify any other workers that the assignments have changed and they must
start a rebalance.</p></li>
<li><p>The membership key is changed in Redis, and a control message is sent to all
listening workers.</p></li>
<li><p>Worker 1 receives a message on the control stream saying that it has joined, so it
performs a rebalance. It attempts to acquire locks in Redis for every partition it
has been assigned.</p></li>
<li><p>The partition locks in Redis are now owned by Worker 1 and it can begin processing
events.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-new-worker-joins">
<h2>A new worker joins<a class="headerlink" href="#a-new-worker-joins" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Next, another worker joins and must coordinate with the first to split up ownership over
partitions.</p>
<img alt="_images/rebalance-2.png" src="_images/rebalance-2.png" />
<ol class="arabic simple" start="5">
<li><p>Worker 2 announces it has joined the group. It does this by editing the membership
key in Redis. Since there is already a worker, it will assign itself partitions 5-8,
while 1-4 will remain with Worker 1. It also adds a message to the control stream to
notify any other workers that the assignments have changed and they must start a
rebalance.</p></li>
<li><p>The membership key is changes in Redis, and a control message is sent to all
listening workers.</p></li>
<li><p>Both workers receive the message on the control stream saying that Worker 2 has
joined, so they initiate a rebalance.</p></li>
<li><p>Worker 1 realises that it is no longer assigned partitions 5-8, so it halts
processing them and releases the corresponding locks in Redis.</p></li>
<li><p>Partitions 5-8 are no longer owned by anyone. Worker 2 realises that it should
acquire them.</p></li>
<li><p>Partitions 5-8 are now owned by Worker 2 and it can begin processing them.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Note that steps 8. and 9. could have happened in reverse. In that case, Worker 2
would have been unable to acquire the locks since Worker 1 would not have released
them yet. Worker 2 would have slept for a small duration before trying again.</p>
<p>Also, note that partitions 1-4 were not affected by the rebalance and Worker 1 did not
have to stop processing them. This greatly benefits processing throughput during
rebalances.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-worker-leaves">
<h2>A worker leaves<a class="headerlink" href="#a-worker-leaves" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Finally, worker 1 leaves the group. Let’s say it has received a termination signal. The
worker’s internal tasks will be cancelled, but its processors currently processing
events will be given a short grace period to complete (e.g. to finish
<a class="reference internal" href="guide.html#acknowledgement"><span class="std std-ref">Acknowledgement</span></a>).</p>
<img alt="_images/rebalance-3.png" src="_images/rebalance-3.png" />
<ol class="arabic simple" start="11">
<li><p>Worker 1 announced it has left the group. It does this by editing the membership key
in Redis. Since there is one remaining worker, it will assign Worker 2 every
partition of the stream. It also adds a message to the control stream to notify any
other workers that the assignments have changed and they must start a rebalance.
Before exiting, Worker 1 releases its partition locks 1-4.</p></li>
<li><p>Partitions 1-4 are no longer owned by anyone. The membership key is changes in
Redis, and a control message is sent to all listening workers.</p></li>
<li><p>Worker 2 receives the message on the control stream saying that Worker 1 has left, so
